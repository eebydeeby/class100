# What is Axiology?
Axiology is the study of value. In philosophy, value is the quality possessed by a thing which makes it good. Some commonly defined values include virtue, beauty, harmony, happiness, justice, or usefulness. Axiologists are also concerned with how and why people arrive to certain value judgements, that is, why we believe some things are good and other things are bad.

Axiology is usually split into two major branches: ethics and aesthetics. Ethics is concerned with moral good, whereas aesthetics deals with beauty.
