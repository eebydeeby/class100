Most introductory courses to the history of philosophy start with the philosophers of Ancient Greece.
Ancient Greek culture stretched all across the Mediterranean, although its "heartlands" are considered to be around the Aegean Sea, between what are now the republics of Greece and Turkey.


Philosophers tend to split the periods of interest into three sections, the first section beginning with Thales of Miletus (b. 626 BC) up to Socrates (b. 470); philosophers from the time are known as "Pre-Socratics". Much of the writing from the Pre-Socratic period is fragmentary, and beginner students are often expected to grasp only a basic survey of this period (although how deep you want to go is entirely up to you).


The second section corresponds roughly with the Classical Period of Ancient Greece, and contains the lives and works of the three most influential Greek philosophers: Socrates, his student Plato, and Plato's own student, Aristotle. Socrates is widely credited as the founder of the Western philosophical tradition, and much of what we know of him was translated and interpreted by Plato. In turn, Plato and Aristotle are considered to have created the two major branches of pre-Modern philosophy: Platonic and Aristotelean. These three philosophers are usually the most intensely studied of all the Greek philosophers, at least at the undergraduate level.


The third section starts in the Hellenistic period, roughly around the death of Aristotle when the Greek Empire was at its largest. This third section also lasts after the fall of Greece and into the Roman Empire, when Greek ideas were absorbed by the Roman intelligentsia. It is during this time that Greek thought had reached the height of its influence in Antiquity. The third section is characterised by the development of different schools of thought, which sprung up either as a response to or continuation of the Socratic tradition. These were the Cynics, Epicureans, Stoics, Sceptics and later the Neoplatonists. This time is also noticeable for the increasing role of women philosophers, such as Hipparchia and Hypatia. The end of this section aligns roughly with the fall of Rome and the start of the Middle Ages in the end of the 5th Century, although Neoplatonism in particular would continue to exert considerable influence on Jewish, Christian and Muslim philosophers in the centuries to follow.
