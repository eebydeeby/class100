# class100

## Welcome to the class100 Project!

The purpose of c100P is to maintain a central, curated directory of free learning materials designed to provide a basic but comprehensive reading of philosophy.
The directory is aimed at beginners and autodidacts, but may serve as a useful supplement for students.

In time, I hope to draft a recommended reading list using only listed materials.

Currently, the directory is structured in this way:

- Axiology
- Epistemology
- General Philosophy
  - History of Philosophy
- Logic
  - Formal Logic
- Metaphysics
